./scripts/run-seed.sh

# Or manually with psql
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/seed.sql
```

### Option 2: TypeScript Seeding (Advanced)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Compatibility
The seeding data is designed to work with your existing Drizzle ORM schema in `shared/schema.ts`. All foreign key relationships are properly maintained.

### Data Relationships
- Users have multiple CPD activities tracked across different categories
- Course enrollments show realistic progress tracking
- Event registrations include proper ticket type selections
- Forum discussions have realistic engagement metrics
- Mentorship opportunities are linked to qualified professionals

### Professional Authenticity
All data reflects realistic Indian sports medicine context:
- Proper Indian names and locations
- Realistic pricing in Indian Rupees
- Accreditation bodies relevant to India (Sports Medicine India, ACSM, NSCA)
- Professional specializations common in sports medicine
- Authentic course durations and CPD point allocations

## üöÄ Running the Seeding

### Prerequisites
1. PostgreSQL database running and accessible via `DATABASE_URL`
2. Database schema already applied (run `npm run db:push` first)

### Execution Steps
1. **Ensure database is ready**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

2. **Run the seeding script**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-seed.sh
   ```

3. **Verify seeding success**:
   - Check the script output for confirmation
   - Login with demo credentials to test the platform

### Troubleshooting
- **Permission denied**: Run `chmod +x scripts/run-seed.sh`
- **Database connection error**: Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
- **Table not found**: Run `npm run db:push` to create schema first

## üßπ Clearing Data

The seeding script includes TRUNCATE statements to clear existing data. To manually clear:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE notifications, messages, credentials, mentorship_connections, 
mentorship_opportunities, discussion_replies, discussions, forum_categories, 
cpd_activities, cpd_categories, course_enrollments, courses, event_registrations, 
ticket_types, events, users RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;
```

## üìà Testing Scenarios

After seeding, you can test these realistic scenarios:

1. **User Registration & Profile Setup**
2. **Course Enrollment & Progress Tracking**
3. **Event Registration & Ticket Selection**
4. **CPD Activity Logging & Verification**
5. **Community Discussions & Mentorship**
6. **Professional Credential Management**
7. **Career Path Recommendations**

## üîÑ Production Considerations

- **Never run seeding on production** - This will delete existing data
- **Backup before seeding** - Always backup your database first
- **Customize data** - Modify the seed files to match your specific requirements
- **Security** - Change default passwords before production use

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues with seeding:
1. Check database connectivity
2. Verify schema is up to date
3. Review the console output for specific errors
4. Ensure all required dependencies are installed

The seeded data provides a comprehensive foundation for testing all platform features while maintaining professional authenticity and realistic user scenarios.
